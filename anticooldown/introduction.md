Title: Introduction

# Introduction

AntiCooldown does what the name already says - it deactivates the PvP Cooldown according to your needs on your server! Enjoy all the new features of the new version and the old PvP system together without compromise with AntiCooldown!

## Features

- **REMOVING PVP COOLDOWN!** Removes the annoying cooldown that has been in existence since 1.9.
- **DISABLED WORLDS!** Decide for yourself where the cooldown should be on or off. By default, the cooldown is disabled everywhere!
- **YOUR SERVER, YOUR DECISIONS!** Change messages, adjust values and more! Almost everything in the config can be adjusted individually.
- **NO LAGS!** Extremely efficient programming! Virtually no server resources are required! No lags - guaranteed!
- **INGAME SETTINGS!** Unlock or activate worlds directly in the game without tediously editing the config!
- **RELOAD RESISTANT!** The plugin is not affected in its function by a "reload" and can handle it without problems.
- **LIVE UPDATING!** A world full of players and the cooldown should be deactivated right now in there? No problem! All settings (ingame settings) will be applied directly LIVE!
- **UPDATE CHECKER!** Get a notification as soon as a new update is available!
