Title: Introduction

# Introduction

AntiCooldown does what the name already says - it deactivates the PvP Cooldown according to your needs on your server! Enjoy all the new features of the new version and the old PvP system together without compromise with AntiCooldown!

## Features

- **PVP COOLDOWN REMOVAL!** Removes the PvP-Cooldown that exists since 1.9.
- **OLD WEAPON DAMAGE!** Can easily overwrite the damage of all weapons and tools at any time, without NBT editing!
- **REMOVES SWEEP ATTACK!** Can remove the Sweep-Attack and does not harm other mobs in the immediate vicinity!
- **DISABLE NEW ATTACK SOUNDS!** The newly added attack sounds can be deactivated. 1.8 feeling guaranteed!
- **REMOVE ATTACK PARTICLES!** The new attack particles (including the sweep attack particles) can be removed.
- **CUSTOM ITEM DAMAGE!** Damage can be overwritten for each item, including the new Netherite tools and weapons!
- **ITEM RESTRICTION!** The cooldown can be temporarily deactivated for items. It can also be used as a whitelist so that only the cooldown of these items is deactivated.
- **PLACEHOLDERS!** AntiCooldown offers placeholders for the PlaceholderAPI, with which the cooldown status of players or the world can be displayed.
- **WORLD TOGGLE!** It is possible to select for each world whether AntiCooldown is active in it or not.
- **PERMISSIONS SYSTEM!** There is a large permission system available which can be activated. This means that features can be enabled/disabled individually for each player/group.
- **BYPASS PERMISSIONS!** Deactivated worlds should be ignored? Simply activate the bypass and give the permissions to a player!
- **YOUR SERVER, YOUR RULES!** Change messages, adjust values and more. Everything in the config file can be customized.
- **INGAME SETTINGS!** Toggle worlds directly ingame without tediously editing the config and restarting/reload the server!
- **NO LAGS!** Extremely efficient programming! Virtually no server resources are required! No lags - guaranteed!
- **NO REFLECTIONS!** We do not use reflections, so as a rule: AntiCooldown can also be used in new versions without an update.
- **RELOAD RESISTANT!** The plugin is not affected in its function by a "reload" and can handle it without problems.
- **LIVE UPDATING!** A world full of players and the cooldown should be deactivated right now in there? No problem! All settings (ingame settings) will be applied directly LIVE!
- **UPDATE CHECKER!** Get a notification as soon as a new update is available!
